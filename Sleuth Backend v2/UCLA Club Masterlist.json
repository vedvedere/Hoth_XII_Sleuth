It has been and continues to be the goal of our program to help people with their taxes and educate them in the procedure of filing a return to help clarify the process and provide assistance to those who otherwise would go without aid. \n\nWe offer UCLA students:\n•  A great opportunity to give back to the community while gaining hands-on experience\n•  Free training on individual income tax preparation\n•  Strong resume builder with tax experience and community service\n•  An opportunity to network with accounting/tax/consulting firms \n•  IRS Certification",

This furthers our efforts in making each member feel welcome; thus, establishing a safe space in which it is possible to communicate thoughts and have an open discussion. We also co-program with many other South Asian Organizations on campus in order to provide students with other outlets, professional and cultural.  In spirituality we have Kirtan nights, set prayer times, meditation, Gurbani and Punjabi classes, and debates on the faith.  Additionally, our association provides the students of UCLA with the opportunity to engage in unique community service efforts such as Sikh Relief (who provide assistance by fighting the drug problem in Punjab, help Sikh Political Prisoners, provide relief in Nepal or anywhere else there is a natural disaster) as well as work with the United Sikh Movement to offer langar (free food) to individuals that lack these resources (i.e. Skid Row, Riverside, and other regions in LA).  Lastly, we make sure our members feel at home and enjoy the beautiful city of LA by hosting mixers, bonfires, beach trips, hikes, movie nights, ice skating and a range of other fun social activities. From day one, we hope to be efficient with our professional lives but at the same time enjoy our college years through Seva, Simran (prayer and mediation), and Kirt (working diligently). We are partnered with the United Sikh Movement, the official link between SSAs across California, to constantly expand and connect with the Sikh sangat at large.",

After realizing that other student organizations would not be able to provide all of these to their members, the founders decided that creating a fraternity, something that was new in Latino culture, would be the best opportunity for achieving its goals. -- Our founders instilled in us the principles of Academic Excellence, through which we will encourage and support Latino males in higher education; Community Service, through which we will give back to the communities that shaped our lives; and the Maintenance of Latino Culture through Brotherhood in establishing the FIRST Latino-Based Organization on the West Coast. -- In 2000, when six gentlemen realized that other student organizations at UCLA would not be able to provide them with opportunities for personal growth, networking, and a chance to contribute meaningfully to both the UCLA campus and the surrounding community, they decided to establish a chapter of this fraternity to provide them the opportunity to achieve these goals. -- Eta Chapter prides itself on being established at the number one public university in the nation. Since it’s inception on January 15th, 2000, Eta Chapter has had a 99% graduation rate, leading to an extensive alumni network with brothers working in a range of professional fields from finance to city government, medicine, law, and everywhere in between. We are not members of this brotherhood for the short time that we are at UCLA;  we are members of this brotherhood for a lifetime. -- At UCLA, we strive to uplift all our brothers and their respective communities. Having multiple brothers from diverse backgrounds, such as the undocumented, LGBTQ+, transfer, and other various historically underrepresented populations, gives us the opportunity to contribute to the betterment of each of these communities. Through a combination of brotherhood, service, and leadership development, the fraternity strives to create well-rounded individuals who are prepared to lead and inspire others to excel. -- Eta Chapter offers a supportive environment where individuals can cultivate lifelong friendships, engage in philanthropic endeavors, and participate in various social and educational activities. By upholding our core values, we play an essential role in enriching the campus community and empowering our members to make a positive impact in society. -- For more than two decades, Gamma Zeta Alpha Fraternity, Inc. at ETA Chapter has been cultivating leaders and strengthening the Latino community at UCLA. As the LARGEST, and LONGEST-STANDING Latino-Based Organization, we will continue to produce sustainability that benefits our surrounding communities here at UCLA.",

Our goal is to make sure that we all grow stronger in knowledge, faith, unity, and love. We do so by providing fun activities, spiritual meetings, prayer meetings, Bible studies, community service, etc. It is not just limited to Copts, but to everyone who is seeking God and would like to find Him; we welcome questions and curiosity! Please ask and contact us if you would like to learn more!",

    "description": "UMMA Volunteer Project (UVP) was founded in 1996 as a volunteer source for the UMMA Community Clinic, a free health clinic established by UCLA graduate and undergraduate students to serve the residents of the South Los Angeles community. Since its opening, UMMA Clinic has served over 30,000 patients, 90% of whom are below the poverty line. UVP has been assisting UMMA Clinic since it's inception and played a crucial role in the clinic's early success by providing a steady group of volunteers to assist at the clinic. UVP allows students the opportunity to volunteer at health fairs, giving them first-hand exposure to the health care field in one of the most underserved regions in the nation. Volunteers also help at the many events in which UMMA Clinic participates, including the Hawthorne Health Fair, Tax Day, Fremont Farmers Market, and Humanitarian Day. \n\nTo further address the needs of the community, UVP is committed to providing preventative health education to students and patients in South Los Angeles.\n\nUVP has established weekly, after-school health and physical education courses at elementary and middle schools in South LA with the aim of promoting healthy living. As part of these courses, students are taught lessons on nutrition and the importance of healthy eating, as well as other health topics. Following each lesson plan are fun and interactive outdoor activities to get the students moving, with the ultimate goal of inspiring a lifelong enjoyment of physical activity.\n\nUVP also runs a weekly program for high schoolers in South LA where students learn about contemporary public health issues and present a capstone project on a topic of their choice. The program aims to develop students' research and critical thinking skills and inspire the next generation of leaders in healthcare.\n\nIn addition to the youth, UVP also aims to educate the adult population of South Los Angeles about various health disorders through the Preventative Health Initiative (PHI). Every week, UVP volunteers spread awareness of initial warning signs, disease prevention, and healthy life-style practices while passing out free food and resources to UMMA Clinic patients and local community members at the Fremont Free Food Fair. These efforts are aimed to curb the prevalence of common health disorders including diabetes, hypertension, and other prevalent conditions.\n\nDue to the current pandemic, the Black and communities of color we serve are facing increased discrimination and lack of access to proper care or resources. With our connection to the UMMA Clinic we are hoping to address this prejudice in providing a health clinic that can provide for them without bias towards their race, income or zip code.  \n\nJoin us in making this change.",

Volunteers work with health professionals, build leadership in health-related community service, interact with patients, become educated on predominant community health issues, and have workshops to help make them strong leaders in the health field and community.\n\nVCH members will be provided with numerous opportunities for community service, leadership development, and mentorship opportunities. Community service opportunities include quarterly VCH-sponsored health fairs, biweekly health sites, and participation at community health fairs sponsored by non-profit organizations that VCH partners with. In addition, there is a leadership development \"internship\" offered each winter quarter. In the program, interns learn about the challenges and rewards that VCH staff members face when making decisions and working collaboratively in a group environment. Interns get the opportunity to apply for a position on VCH staff, as well as a Committee Head; nonetheless, the skills gained from the internship are easily applicable to any other leadership and management position.",

DM has become an iconic event within the UCLA community, so much that it's considered a “True Bruin Tradition.” Since its founding, PAC has raised over $6 million for our beneficiaries: The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, The Laurel Foundation, and the UCLA AIDS Institute. In addition to planning and participating in DM, members of PAC participate in promotional events, fundraisers, and volunteer opportunities, both at UCLA and within the wider Los Angeles community. PAC is constantly seeking to unite students, activists, and leaders around our cause, and with 17 diverse committees, PAC has a place for you.

Healthcare is a highly regulated industry, and with the new health reform bill, the law concerning healthcare is growing and changing. This means that health law is an exciting area of study as well as a great field for lawyers to enter into. Reflecting this trend, UCLA has been adding to its health law curriculum with courses offered by Professor Hoffman in Health Insurance Reform and Health Law and Policy.  We would like to supplement this curriculum by bringing in experts to discuss various components of health law and enlighten students on relevant issues. We will also strive to enhance the employment prospects for students interested in health law by bringing potential employers to network with students. HLS will heighten the profile of UCLA as an attractive choice for prospective students in health law and will strengthen connections between the school and the legal community.",

Instead, we see the two entities as active partners in a fruitful relationship that is continuing to evolve in significant and important ways. Thus, not only do we hope to advocate student engagement on campus, but we also hope to extend that engagement to the community of Los Angeles. As citizens and students of this active, moving city, we must recognize our own interdependence, our own parallel currents; we must become more conscious of the direction in which we are moving; and the Office of the Internal Vice President is committed to doing this.",

Some walk for days, weeks, or months without having access to basic necessities such as clean water or properly fitted shoes. Many even refuse to air out their feet, conducive of many foot problems, afraid that their shoes might get stolen. As we, Happy Feet Clinic, provide those basic necessities and more, we are blessed with a powerfully humbling experience.\n\nAt shelters around Los Angeles, including the Union Rescue Mission in downtown L.A., the Ocean Park Community Center in Santa Monica, the New Image Emergency Shelter in South LA, and PATH in Westwood, we treat hundreds of homeless people to a soothing foot wash in a tub of warm, soapy water. Next, we work side by side with podiatrists as they administer foot exams for the homeless community. Throughout the process, we interact with a variety of people in need of help and most importantly become aware of the large prominence of under-served communities and their critical need for assistance.\n\nFor many students, it is hard to grasp how prominent this population is in a thriving country as America. At first, students squirm at the thought of washing feet (especially those that may need much more care than our own). As soon as the event comes to an end however, many are instilled with the feeling to return again and again.\n\nThe power to help someone who has lost family, work, and shelter and put a smile on their face is an amazing feeling. This is what makes our organization unique.\n\nAny student with an interest in reaching out to under-served communities is invited to join.",

    "description": "The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) is a professional organization for chemical engineers. AIChE was established in 1908 with the purpose of establishing chemical engineers as a profession independent from chemists and mechanical engineers.\n\nThe mission of the AIChE student chapter at UCLA is to promote excellence in the Chemical Engineering Department of the School of Engineering and Applied Science by providing resources and support to the undergraduate students so that they can succeed academically and advance professionally.\n\nAIChE's vision is to provide value as the global leader of the chemical engineering profession and be the lifetime center for professional and personal growth.\n\nIn 1908 a small group of chemical engineers formed a professional society to promote and improve chemical engineering as a discipline. At first, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) met with strong resistance, especially from the American Chemical Society (ACS), which claimed control over all pure and applied chemistry in the United States. In response, AIChE adopted a number of conservative measures, including strict membership criteria to keep membership low and avoid competition with ACS. Nonetheless, the value of AIChE was realized by the entire discipline in 1925, when chemical engineering became the first profession to use scholastic accreditation to ensure the consistency and quality of academic chemical engineering courses. The conservative attitude paid off when peace was made between ACS and AIChE around 1930. The membership criteria were lifted and chemical engineers joined in droves.\n\nToday AIChE remains the principal chemical engineering professional society in the United States. Currently about 57,000 (~70%) of American chemical engineers are members.",

Membership is open to graduate and undergraduate men and women who are making the study of psychology one of their major interests, and who meet the minimum qualifications. Psi Chi is a member of the Association of College Honor Societies and is an affiliate of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the American Psychological Society (APS).\n\nPsi Chi functions as a federation of chapters located at over 1,000 senior colleges and universities in the USA and Canada. The Central Office is located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. A Board of Directors, composed of psychologists who are Psi Chi members and who are elected by the chapters, guides the affairs of the organization and sets policy with the approval of the chapters.\n\nWhat are the Goals of Psi Chi?\n\nPsi Chi serves two major goals. The first of these is the Society’s obligation to provide academic recognition to its inductees by the mere fact of membership. The second goal is the obligation of each of the Society’s local chapters to nurture the spark of that accomplishment by offering a climate congenial to its creative development. For example, the chapters make active attempts to nourish and stimulate professional growth through programs designed to augment and enhance the regular curriculum and to provide practical experience and fellowship through affiliation with the chapter. In addition, the international organization provides programs to help achieve these goals, including Society and regional conventions held annually in conjunction with the psychological associations, research award competitions, and certificate recognition programs.",

This is a place where you can grapple with philosophical questions, and we can mutually work together to try to better our understanding of the world, our behavior within it, and whether or not we are justified in our beliefs. Whether you have only a budding interest in philosophy or if you are well versed in philosophical discourse, the club is a great way to expand your knowledge of the field and make friends along the way.\n\nWEEKLY MEETING\nMeetings are held every Tuesday at 6 pm in Dodd 399 (On Discord https://discord.gg/8YcZ3Uu during pandemics). During meetings, we discuss a specific philosophical issue for about an hour and a half. Topics are chosen and presented by any club members and often explore topics not commonly covered in undergraduate courses, e.g.: philosophy of progress, experience machine, and animal rights. We encourage you to present your own ideas! Sometimes we host philosophy-themed movie nights instead. \nWe often go to Westwood for dinner after our weekly meetings to continue the discussion. \n\nMEDITATIONS PHILOSOPHY JOURNAL\nMeditations is the undergraduate journal of philosophy at UCLA. The purpose of the journal is to foster philosophical thought and provide an opportunity for undergraduates to gain writing and publishing experience. Maybe you have a philosophy paper that you’re really proud of, or you’re looking for a platform to test your arguments and be challenged. Maybe you have some cool ideas but hate writing when a grade depends on it. We encourage undergraduates of any major to participate in Meditations.\n\nBOOKCLUBS\nYou can also be a part of our book club. The book club offers a chance to do a close reading of philosophical texts. During our weekly discussions, we will try to understand the ideas presented in the readings by breaking down nuances such as rhetoric and symbolism.\n\nOTHER PROGRAMS\nWe encourage members to attend events organized by the Philosophy Department. We also cooperate with the department to plan events for you. For example coffee time with professors, study lounge, and information panel, and more.\n\nFacebook: Undergraduate Philosophy Club at UCLA",

We do so by hosting events, workshops, and speakers that tackle issues such as exercise, eating disorders, body dysmorphia, mental health, and self esteem. Living as college students in Los Angeles, we want to help students understand how influenced we all are by media images and we want to give students the tools to combat these influences. The media has given us a specific image of what is beautiful, and we want to encourage every student on campus to feel confident and beautiful no matter how their body looks. By improving our self esteem, we can focus less time on our physical appearance and more time on living our lives. We hope to enhance the self esteem of students by demonstrating beauty isn’t only skin-deep, and by pushing students to be positive with themselves and not to be so critical. We also want to show how physical health affects mental health. We want to teach students ways to take care of their own health which will help them feel better. For instance we emphasize healthy eating and fitness, but encourage individuals to focus on feeling good rather than looking good. We want to make help accessible to those who are struggling with body dismorphia or eating disorders. Through our programming, we hope to educate the student body on these issues and how to tackle them. The Body Image Task Force also aims to help students learn how to handle college stress. We hope to provide stress outlets because we believe that mental health is also connected to self esteem and in general happiness. As students, we all face a variety of obstacles that can ultimately hold us back. We hope to reduce these personal barriers to help each student here reach their full potential.",

    "description": "Founded in 2012, Resonance began as a quintet that quickly grew in both size and sound, becoming one of the premier a cappella ensembles at UCLA. Over the past couple years, Resonance has established itself as a vibrant a cappella group with a unique sound and a high level of musical excellence.\nIn 2014 and 2016, the group qualified and performed for an audience of 10,000 at UCLA's Spring Sing, the university's largest, highly competitive musical showcase. In 2015, 2017, and 2018, Resonance competed in the Los Angeles A Cappella Festival (LAAF). In 2017, the group competed for the very first time at the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA), placing 2nd at the Southwest Quarterfinal, 3rd at the Southwest Semifinal, and winning awards for Outstanding Arrangement at both competitions. In 2017, Resonance also recorded their first studio album, \"In This Light\", which is available now on iTunes and Spotify. Since then, singles \"Bad Romance\", \"September\", and \"Praying Fools\" have been released. In 2018 and 2020, Resonance competed in the ICCA once more, winning Outstanding Arrangement and placing 1st in the West Quarterfinals both years. In the year 2021, Resonance competed in the first virtual ICCA competition, placing 1st at both the West Quarterfinal and Semifinal, advancing them to finals. Guided by their passion for performing and friendship, Resonance hopes to share their music with their community and make a lasting impact. As such, Resonance can be found performing at a number of philanthropy events and concerts across California, the greater Los Angeles area, and on the UCLA campus during a typical year.",

The NBLJ was started in 1970 by 5 African-American law students and 2 African-American law professors. The Journal was the first of its kind in the country. Because of the drop in African-American students at UCLA School of Law after the passage of proposition 209, the journal was sent to Columbia where publication could be continued.\nOne of the Journals founding editors noted that it was important that there be a forum for providing a theoretical framework for practical daily application of Black legal ideas and concepts. The Journal has aimed to build on this tradition by publishing articles that make a substantive contribution to current dialogue taking place around issues such as affirmative action, employment law, the criminal justice system, community development and labor issues. The Journal has a commitment to publish articles that inspire new thought, explore new alternatives and contribute to current jurisprudential stances.\nIn 2005, a group of students at UCLA began the process of bringing the journal back to its birthplace through the organization of a symposium entitled \"Regression Analysis: The Status of African Americans in American Legal Education.\" In the Fall of 2009, a group of committed students reformed the NBLJ Board and in Spring 2010, NBLJ published at UCLA for the first time in over a decade.",

Both programs have expanded into well-ordered and effective student-operated organizations, each consisting of roughly 25 students rigorously chosen from UCLA's student body.\n\nStudents in Student Stroke Team have the opportunity to experience neurorounds, which involve shadowing the Ronald Reagan Stroke Team on their morning rounds. On these neurorounds, students gain exposure to the field of stroke neurology, emergency medicine, and patient interaction. Members also participate in general meetings where they learn and present case studies and lessons about neurovasculature, imaging, the basics of clinical research, and current stroke clinical trials at UCLA. \n\nAs research associates, students learn the basis for the investigation of new drugs and interventions in stroke, the pre-clinical research, the phases of trials, and the proper interpretation of the results obtained. In their tasks, students utilize their knowledge of the study hypothesis and methodology, patient selection criteria, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and rationale for the use of the drug procedure.",

When a client chooses an accompanied appointment, they attend with a companion whose role is to facilitate a sense of felt safety, comfort, and agency for the client. Practically, accompaniment entails filling out paperwork, communicating long-term goals, and arranging transportation, in addition to tackling any other barriers between clients and the services that they deserve.

In the Stroke Force program, undergraduates are involved in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter research projects investigating the efficacy of various drugs and procedures applied to the patients that arrive in the UCLA Emergency Room with onset of acute ischemic stroke. Students serve as research associates and work alongside neurologists during code strokes. Responsibilities include collecting information relating to the patient’s medical history and neurological deficits in order to identify potential candidates for enrollment in clinical trials that aim to find novel treatments for stroke. Students also serve as speakers who reach out to various communities. To date, more than 200 students have participated in the program, delivering over 300 lectures to over 7000 individuals. Formal testing has demonstrated that these presentations are highly effective, resulting in a significant increase in post-education stroke awareness. Through integrating experiences from clinical exposure in the Ronald Reagan Emergency Department, neurological rounds, health fairs, and presentations, this sect of the Stroke Program strives to provide a force to minimize response time and to facilitate treatment.",

We will also provide shadowing opportunities, enabling students to get hands-on experience with cardiology patients. Lastly, the Cardiology Interest Group will provide opportunities for medical students to get to know cardiology fellows and attending physicians through social events and mixers, thus creating a collegial atmosphere to foster interest in cardiology. We hope this group will spark interest in pursuing a career path in one of the cardiology specialties to balance the growing need for cardiologists both in the clinical and research realms.\n\nPROVISION TO MAKE FINANCIAL RECORDS AVAILABLE - We will make financial records available to university administrators upon request.\n\nUC NONDISCRIMINATION STATEMENT – Cardiology Interest Group does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, pregnancy, disability, age, medical condition (cancer-related), ancestry, marital status, citizenship, sexual orientation, or status as a Vietnam-era veteran or special disabled veteran.

Officers will be elected at the beginning of each academic year. The membership of the organization shall consist of any UCLA undergraduate or graduate student. All officers of the student organizations must be current UCLA undergraduates or graduate students. Officers found not to be a current UCLA student will be removed immediately.\n\nELIGIBILITY FOR VOTING PRIVILEGES and VOTING PROCEDURES – officers will vote annually on changes to the constitution.\n\nPROCEDURES FOR AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION – changes to the constitution will be made upon a simple majority vote by the officers.",

UGSP is designed to provide valuable social support to these students whom may otherwise find it difficult to pursue their graduate studies. Through activities, mentorship, and community outreach, we hope to provide a community that encourages the potential and promise of those from underrepresented groups.  By promoting and improving multicultural training in psychology, we hope to not only increase ethnic minority student recruitment, retention, and graduation but also improve intergroup relations within our department. UGSP operates with the following branches:\n\nUGSP Brown Bag Committee\nThis committee organizes a lecture series that is open to all graduate students. These talks are given by faculty members and post-doctoral students from underrepresented backgrounds or whose research focuses on diversity issues. Each Brown Bag lecture includes both a research presentation and a career development component. This speaker series allows graduate students to network with prominent faculty members from underrepresented groups, hopefully fostering a sense social connectedness and community within the Psychology Department.\n\nUGSP Undergraduate Outreach Committee \nThis committee organizes panels for undergraduate students to learn about various aspects of the graduate student experience. We hope to galvanize interest in graduate school by offering examples of successful underrepresented students from their own university. We also hope that this will provide undergraduates with the opportunity to connect with graduate students so they feel comfortable asking questions about diversity in graduate school.\n\nUGSP High School Outreach Committee \nAs members of underrepresented groups, we find it imperative to give back to our communities through teaching, education, and service.  UGSP will target high schools in low-income neighborhoods and will hold lectures for both parents and students about getting into college.\n\nUGSP Transfer Outreach Committee\nThis committee is dedicated to providing resources and improving the experiences of the diverse group of transfer students at UCLA. A central goal of this committee is to serve transfers as they navigate their undergraduate experience and provide tools and information as they set future goals by creating/hosting events and building community between undergraduate and graduate students. \n\nUGSP Social Committee \nThe Social Committee plans and coordinates various events each year, typically off campus. Our goal in organizing these events is to foster a sense of community among UGSP members. It is a chance for students to interact with people that come from diverse backgrounds who share similar experiences.",

    "description": "The Anesthesiology Interest Group at David Geffen School of Medicine aims to increase awareness and interest in Anesthesiology as it is a specialty that students have very little exposure to in the preclinical as well as in many students’ clinical years. It provides opportunities for students to learn about the specialty, become involved in research/mentorship/shadowing, and acquire hands-on practical skills with common procedures and techniques. We provide opportunities to attend anesthesia related workshops such as an airways lab to allow students to gain experience in intubating a patient and doing a cricothyroidotomy. We complete this mission through a variety of activities: \n\n-Airway management workshop co-hosted with other DGSOM student interest groups. Students are given a short introductory presentation on airway anatomy, followed by a hands-on workshop where students learn and practice intubation, as well as work with Glidescopes, fiber optic scopes, LMAs, and mask ventilation.\n\n-Pre-shadowing orientation in the Anesthesiology department at UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center.\n\n-Multiple interactive, case-based talks given by residents and professors of the Anesthesiology department at UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center.",

There will be a certain number of mentees assigned to a single mentor that will be available to advise them during scheduled office hours that also serve as a study period. Approaching mentoring with low mentor to mentee ratios is what develops the close relationships, and employing undergraduates, who are more relatable than graduate students or professors, creates a more affable environment. Furthermore, we hope to form relationships with other health organizations to create a network for internship and research opportunities.

The aspiration of Lifestyle Medicine Interest Group (LMIG) at DGSOM is to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to counsel patients about exercise, diet, behavior change, and preventative medicine, taking into account positive psychology and the social determinants of health. \nThe goals of LMIG are to:\n- Educate students about how to address lifestyle-based management of chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, celiac disease, and obesity.\n- Train students regarding how to provide accurate and helpful Lifestyle Medicine counseling to patients and make targeted recommendations for patients that would fit their budget, life-style and other socio-economic determinants.\n- Enrich students’ knowledge about exercise, diet and nutrition, behavior change, positive psychology and wellness coaching, and the power of preventative medicine.\n- Help students gain confidence when speaking to patients about lifestyle-based health behaviors and offer personalized advice that is accurate and evidence-based.\n\nThe focus of lunch and learn lectures, presentations, workshops, and participation in community health fairs is not only to educate students about lifestyle medicine and chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, but to help them integrate the experience that they will acquire in clinical settings and beyond.\n\nMembers of LMIG will become registered members of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) which will provide evidence-based Lifestyle Medicine training as the first treatment option in clinical practice through live and online CME-accredited events and educational offerings, certification, clinical practice tools, patient education resources, economic research, networking opportunities, national conferences and advocacy efforts.",

Our goal is to facilitate discussions and events centering on the impact of these intersecting issues on community health, thereby fostering intrapersonal, interpersonal, and collective growth among UCLA nursing students and within the UCLA community overall. \n\nWe believe that, as healthcare providers serving diverse populations, it is of utmost importance that we better understand how societal injustices are rooted deeply in a historical context and are continuously reproduced to the detriment of achieving health equity for marginalized groups. It is our duty as student nurses to provide the best possible care to those we serve. In order to achieve this aim, we must learn to address our own internal biases and understand relevant historical and cultural context in order to advocate for our patients. We also want to think critically about how nurses, and other healthcare professionals, have been complicit in these systems of injustice throughout history, and how we can instead use our positions to dismantle these inequities. Ultimately, we envision a future healthcare system that is more just and more equitable, and we aim to play a role in its creation.",

In addition, we plan to fundraise for the tools and resources to foster the students’ interests in reading and bring awareness to the success reading can have on a child’s creativity and future.",

These trainings are critical, not only because they empower underserved youth to pursue careers in health medicine and slowly add to the mosaic of representation, but also because they propagate life-saving information throughout communities neglected by systems of healthcare and health education.",

As different types of MD can cause quite specific problems, the treatment one receives will be tailored to their specific needs. As a member of Muscular Dystrophy Society on Campus (MDS), we aim to raise funds, do volunteer work, and donate to research facilities specialized in MD. We further aim to spread awareness of MD through partnering with the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA), and bringing to light related neuromuscular diseases in the greater UCLA community.

    "description": "As part of efforts to come up with a new model for community outreach about breast cancer, UCSF's San Francisco Cancer Initiative Breast Cancer Task Force (SFCAN) discussed the idea of Teens for Screens (T4S) in 2018. In the course of numerous meetings and collaboration with community-based organizations geared toward the underserved population of San Francisco, the concept of creating a sustainable model of outreach to raise awareness of breast cancer among youth to educate their families and communities was developed. In addition to the support of SFCAN through the funding and resources they provided, the T4S pilot program would not have been possible without the leadership of Dr. Laura Fejerman, Dr. Ana Velasquez, Tania Dugatkin, and UCSF staff. We recognize them for the time, passion, support, and dedication they have contributed to T4S.\n \nIn the Fall of 2019, T4S launched and empowered high school students with information to advocate for breast cancer screenings and healthy behaviors among their friends, families, and communities. In this vein, Teens for Screens at UCLA has adopted this model with a twist. To implement this model, UCLA Teens for Screens seeks to train undergraduate students as breast cancer educators to have them educate middle and high schoolers locally either in-person or remotely. As part of our outreach efforts, we aim to partner with high schools with high populations of underserved groups, such as low-income students and minorities, to provide them with information about breast cancer and the importance of screening. We also aim to provide one-on-one mentorship, with a culminating capstone project at the end of each program. As we continue this journey behind Teens for Screens, we hope that we can spread awareness about an often under-discussed, yet important issue.",

We are united in our belief that capitalism—a system where all wealth and power is held by a small group of billionaires and their state—is the source of the main problems confronting humanity today. It must be replaced by socialism, a system where poor and working people control all the wealth and power of society, using it to plan for and meet the needs of the people and planet.",

OutWrite strives to build a growing educational platform through a multi-media approach that uplifts and empowers the often silenced voices of the incredibly diverse queer community. We aim to challenge dominant cisheteronormative narratives through an unapologetically anti-queerphobic, anti-racist, and progressive lens. \n\nOutWrite was established in 1979 under its original title TenPercent, becoming the first queer college publication in the country. The name TenPercent was chosen from the Alfred Kinsey’s study Sexual Behavior in the Human Male which stated that 10% of men identified as homosexual. In 2005, the newsmagazine’s staff petitioned to change the name to OutWrite to decenter the white, cis, gay male identity and use a name which better represents the queer community’s vast spectrum of identities.\n\nThroughout the years, the newsmagazine referred to itself as a \"gay and lesbian\" newsmagazine, slowly adding more identities to its moniker just as the mainstream community did in the late 20th century. Our label has since been changed to \"queer\" newsmagazine to recognize both the importance of inclusivity in our community and the inherent radical nature of our mission; queer is a verb and political statement as much as it is an umbrella descriptor encompassing the ever-growing LGBTQ+ acronym. OutWrite is proud to transform and adapt itself to better represent and serve queer people, changing its own identity as our community grows and changes.",

We envision a world where farmers & growers are compensated fairly for their labor; where soil and land are treated as the invaluable resources that they are; and where all people have access to culturally appropriate, locally grown, highly nutritious food for an affordable price. \n\nWe’re challenging the unequal distribution of food access in our market, driven by the United States’ subsidization of commodity crops that prioritizes quantity and revenue over public health. Our CSA program provides a radical alternative to this system by supplying locally grown food to our student body that is affordable & accessible. Additionally, our programs aim to reconnect consumers with the land and people who grew the food they eat, as we believe that our most intimate connection to our planet is the food it grows for us. We are also committed to partnering with other campus clubs to provide fresh produce to food-insecure students. Lastly, we write and publish articles that spread awareness about sustainable and ethical farming.",

We do not plan to charge a membership fee to join, but we will charge a small event fee to cover the cost of each event (venue, refreshments, etc, - speakers will volunteer their time). We will promote our club on social media (Instagram, Reddit, Discord, and LinkedIn). And we will have a booth at the club day, where officers will recruit members and hand out flyers and stickers with our Bruin Mates logo. \n\nWhile UCLA is a large and vibrant campus, there are not enough clubs that serve students who want to participate in career enhancing activities on campus. This is evidenced by the very low acceptance rate into existing networking clubs. We will be a welcoming and inclusive business networking community without any requirements of major or GPA to discourage participation. Our founders include four-year and transfer students, students who live both on and off-campus, students with business, liberal arts and fine arts majors. We have substantial work experience and depth in the LA community that will enable us to attract corporate speakers and support.\n\nOur goal is to build a community of career-minded Bruins where we connect ambitious students with professionals in various industries so they can learn and build meaningful relationships. We hope to empower our club by providing events that connect our members to one another. We will do this by hosting various events such as club meetings, team bonding activities, and having guest speakers talk about their experience in their respective fields.\n\nThe founding members are very excited to put our plans into action this fall.

Since 2021, NDHC has improved access to resources and credible information for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD). NDHC is directly responsive to the well-established findings that neurodivergent populations have experienced disproportionate negative mental and physical health outcomes from the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nNDHC applies a multi-pronged strategy to support neurodivergent populations. First, NDHC leverages social media to translate and disseminate valuable information on vaccination guidelines, needle anxieties, and barriers to vaccination. NDHC is highly adept at creating and disseminating plain language and accessible social media infographics through a range of channels, as well as conducting and sharing in-depth interviews with public health experts and individuals with lived experience.\n\nIn addition to these outreach efforts, NDHC leads a portfolio of research. Last year, NDHC conducted a qualitative research study that analyzed key themes from interviews with medical and non-medical health professionals, communicators, and individuals with I/DD and their caregivers. Qualitative findings revealed that misinformation, vaccine risk perception, sensory sensitivities, and structural hardship were the most significant barriers to COVID-19 vaccination. \n\nIn order to be responsive to the findings from our research study, NDHC embarked on the development and dissemination of a virtual CME/CE to promote vaccine confidence, access, and uptake in neurodivergent populations.",

We believe that the bible calls us to be excellent in all areas of life and that includes our education. We encourage students to be disciplined in their studies and keep an excellent work ethic as they study the bible and attend their classes. \n\nThese bible studies have changed the lives of so many individuals. We've had people come addicted to drugs, plagued with anxiety and stress, hurt emotionally, with no hope and the list goes on and on. We help them see that God has a plan for their life and show them what a life with God could look like. So many have seen true happiness and hope for the very first time and their lives are forever changed. \n\nOutside of personal bible studies we offer club meetings throughout the week as well as a Sunday service with the home church we are apart of. This gives students a valuable sense of belonging within a community full of sold out believers focused on taking care of each other and display the love of Christ. We do not discriminate anyone but welcome all who want to study the bible and get to know Jesus. We invite all types of people from all different types backgrounds and upbringings to check out what were all about!",

We work to make a difference in these children’s lives, spread awareness of the lifelong harm caused by appearance-related stigma, and promote acceptance of facial diversity.\n\n\nChildren with facial differences often endure the pain of teasing, bullying, and isolation— pain that can leave emotional scars that last a lifetime. Children that face the world with a difference also endure the challenge of a more silent, but just as damaging, form of stigma: that of unconscious bias. And so, many children with differences grow up in a world that tells them that their dreams must be smaller than those of their peers.\n\n\nMagical Moments is working to change all of that. We create magical experiences that restore hope and provide comfort, inspiration, and encouragement to children with facial differences that are the result of genetic disorders, congenital anomalies, cancer treatment, severe trauma and burns. We help children understand that they are not at all limited by their appearance, but only by the size of their dreams! Through the magical moments that we create, we not only make a difference in children’s lives, but we also promote awareness of the lifelong harm caused by appearance-related stigma and create more widespread acceptance of facial diversity within our communities.\n\n\nAs an organization, we grant wishes that teach children with facial differences to believe in themselves while teaching the world to see and celebrate the beauty in every child!",

    "description": "Introduction:\nThe Addiction Awareness Association (AAA) is a dynamic and dedicated college club committed to addressing one of the most pressing public health issues of our time – addiction. Founded on the principles of compassion, education, and community involvement, AAA has been making a profound impact on and off campus by raising awareness, preventing addiction, and connecting vulnerable communities with crucial rehabilitation resources. In this comprehensive description, we will delve into the mission, activities, and impact of AAA, highlighting its invaluable role in fostering a society that is better informed, more compassionate, and equipped to battle addiction.\n\nMission and Vision:\nThe core mission of the Addiction Awareness Association is to bridge the gap between local needs and rehabilitation resources to combat addiction effectively. AAA envisions a society where addiction is met with understanding, support, and accessible resources, rather than stigma and isolation. This vision is founded on the belief that addiction is a treatable illness, and those affected by it deserve a chance at recovery, regardless of their background.\n\nKey Objectives:\n1. Awareness: AAA seeks to dispel myths and misconceptions surrounding addiction. Through workshops, seminars, and awareness campaigns, the club strives to educate the college community and the wider public about the root causes, consequences, and signs of addiction.\n\n2. Prevention: AAA takes a proactive approach by working to prevent addiction before it takes hold. Club members engage in outreach programs to educate local schools, colleges, and communities about the dangers of substance abuse, providing information on risk factors and healthy coping strategies.\n\n3. Rehabilitation: The heart of AAA's mission is to connect vulnerable communities with rehabilitation resources. Club members actively research and collaborate with local rehab centers, support groups, and counselors to ensure that those in need can access treatment and support.\n\nApproach:\nAAA operates on a needs-based approach, recognizing that addiction impacts different communities in various ways. The club seeks to understand the specific challenges faced by local communities and tailors its initiatives accordingly. This empathetic approach allows AAA to make a meaningful impact and build trust within the communities it serves.\n\nActivities and Initiatives:\n1. Community Surveys: AAA conducts regular surveys and interviews within the local community to gauge the extent of addiction-related issues. These surveys are vital in identifying gaps in knowledge and resources.\n\n2. Resource Coordination: Once needs are identified, AAA collaborates with local rehab centers, support groups, and healthcare providers to connect individuals struggling with addiction to appropriate resources. This includes organizing transportation, financial assistance, and counseling services.\n\n3. Awareness Campaigns: AAA organizes a variety of awareness campaigns, from informational flyers and online webinars to panel discussions and guest speakers. These events aim to educate both the college campus and the wider community about addiction and its impact.\n\n4. School Outreach: Members of AAA visit local schools to engage with students on the dangers of substance abuse, providing them with age-appropriate information and resources to make informed decisions.\n\n5. Peer Support: The club runs support groups for individuals in recovery, providing a safe and non-judgmental space for sharing experiences and offering peer support.\n\nImpact:\nThe Addiction Awareness Association's impact extends beyond the college campus. By focusing on local needs and collaborating with existing resources, AAA has played a pivotal role in improving the lives of individuals and communities affected by addiction. Some of the key impacts include:\n\n1. Increased Awareness: AAA has reached thousands of individuals through its awareness campaigns, contributing to a better-informed society that is more empathetic towards those struggling with addiction.\n\n2. Prevention: By educating local schools and colleges, AAA has helped prevent substance abuse among young adults, empowering them to make healthier choices.\n\n3. Rehabilitation Support: Through its resource coordination efforts, AAA has facilitated hundreds of individuals' access to treatment, counseling, and support services.\n\n4. Community Engagement: The club has fostered a sense of community among those affected by addiction, reducing isolation and stigma and promoting a supportive environment for recovery.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Addiction Awareness Association embodies the spirit of volunteerism, compassion, and community engagement. By addressing addiction at its core and working tirelessly to bridge the gap between local needs and rehabilitation resources, AAA has become a beacon of hope for individuals and communities grappling with the scourge of addiction.",

    "description": "The Hidden Opponent x Sports Psychology Club (THO x SPC) is designed to promote mental health to the student-athletes on campus. We would work hand in hand with the coaches and student-athletes to give them access to mental health resources that are designed specifically for student-athletes. Everyone undergoes stress at school, but there is a stigma surrounding student-athletes and how they manage their stress. With the stress of school on top of their sport, we could find ways to reduce the stressors in their lives, while giving them information and guidance about how they can value the importance of their mental health. We would provide student outreach programs specifically for the student-athletes that raise awareness about the importance of mental health. One example of this could be by bringing in a licensed clinical sports psychologist who is trained to work with professional athletes to campus, and hold a seminar for the student-athletes so they could learn from a professional. The main goal of this club is to provide positive mental health resources and spread awareness for this particular group of students, because sports psychology is very niche and overlooked. Hopefully, this club will serve as a way to positively incorporate mental health into the lives of student-athletes, and raise awareness for any mental health-related issues these students may be experiencing. We will also make this club extremely accessible for the student-athletes themselves, because we understand it is hard for these students to get involved in clubs on campus due to their busy schedules. We would do so by holding meetings on Google Meet as well as in-person, as that may be easier to fit into their busy schedules if they would like to join. We will also provide detailed notes and announcements via Google Classroom, Slack, and email. This way, if students do not have time to watch or attend meetings, they can stay in the loop and still be involved in the club to whatever capacity they can contribute. We will also definitely reach out to the coaches privately, and ask them if there are any specific things they think would be beneficial to help their student-athletes during the academic year. We would also love to administer a survey to all the student-athletes, where they could give us their anonymous opinions about things they are stressed about, so we could try to find ways to alleviate those stressors. We are also an official chapter of \"The Hidden Opponent\", a nationwide nonprofit organization that promotes mental health awareness for student-athletes across high school and college campuses. With this organization, we are able to provide resources and break the stigma on mental health in sports. We work with the NCAA and Club Sports Teams to host mental health awareness games, where we shine light on the importance of mental health with the help of a specific sports team. Working with \"The Hidden Opponent\" is an amazing way to promote mental health awareness in sports to student-athletes, as well as any student who either partakes in a sport on or off campus, or has a passion for mental health in the sports industry.",

    "description": "According to a study conducted in 2017, the average EMS response time is about 6 minutes. However, this number was roughly doubled in rural settings, with nearly 1 in 10 encounters resulting in a wait time of over half an hour. When applying these metrics to some of the leading causes of death in the emergency prehospital setting (cardiac arrest and traumatic bleeding), an issue becomes apparent – time. \n\nThe brain begins to suffer damage after roughly 4 minutes without oxygen and progresses toward irreversible damage after about 7 minutes. There are about half a million deaths from cardiac arrest in the U.S. every year, but a study conducted in 2009 revealed that, out of 138 bystanders who called 911 for a cardiac-related emergency, about half of the cardiac arrests were not detected. \n\nSimilar patterns can be observed in bleeding emergencies, with over one-third of mortality from all traumatic injuries being attributed to severe hemorrhage and roughly 50% of hemorrhage-related deaths occurring before reaching a hospital.\n\nWith most medical emergencies benefitting from immediate intervention, an effective approach to improving patient outcomes involves placing everyday people at the forefront of the medical care team. Understanding how to effectively engage the emergency response system and provide basic first aid (i.e. bleed control and CPR) can drastically improve a patient’s likelihood of survival. \n\nPrevious research has highlighted the efficacy of bystander training programs in improving patient outcomes and increasing bystander confidence in providing medical aid:\n\n“Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by laypersons (so-called bystanders) improves the chances of survival by a factor of 2-4” - Current Opinion in Critical Care (2015).\n\n“The proportion of students showing willingness to perform BLS increased from 13% to 77% after [training] even when the collapsed person is a stranger” — Resuscitation (2016).\n\nWith the aim of improving accessibility to bystander medical training, the Everyday Responder Project (ERP) was founded in December 2020 by two students at the University of Southern California. The current ERP team consists of a variety of healthcare, educational, and creative professionals who are passionate about developing and teaching medical content. With the help of ERP’s volunteers, the organization has begun to pilot its core curriculum and work on larger, longitudinal projects that will help improve medical literacy and emergency preparedness in the various communities across California and beyond.",

The club consists of illustrators who create illustrations to pair up with accepted submissions, similar to how the NYT Modern Love column is run. Guest Speakers: Invite guest speakers, such as authors, members from allied clubs on Campus, and individuals who have shared their own love stories in the Modern Love column, to provide insights and engage in Q&A sessions. Modern Love @UCLA also aims to organize workshops on storytelling and creative writing to encourage members to share their own love stories, whether they are heartwarming, humorous, or thought-provoking.\nEvery once in a while, we screen episodes from the Modern Love show on Amazon that explore the themes of love and relationships, followed by group discussions and conversation.\nThe Modern Love @ UCLA is a celebration of human connection and diversity. It provides a space for members to connect, learn, and share in the beauty and challenges of love in all its forms.",

While diversity of ideas is crucial to any democratic system, our unwillingness to deliberate with those of varying opinions is creating a continuously enlarging rift that is becoming more problematic by the day.

From various backgrounds, beliefs, and positions, we unite here with the collective goal to alleviate society's communication gap: to move forward, we must find common ground. \n\nAs a collective, we wish not to push specific beliefs or opinions; rather, we want to create and facilitate a safe space for communication between disagreeing groups, as this current environment is lacking at UCLA and in broader society. \n\nWe first aim to set up a Public Forum for deliberation on various topics to achieve this goal. These forums aren't meant to decide a winner or which side is right. The purpose of these forums is for disagreeing groups to gain a better understanding of one another. A student moderator assigned by our club board will ensure discourse remains respectful and the goal of understanding is accomplished. \n\nThe Public Forum is the only event we have committed to planning as of now, but we plan to branch out further into the UCLA community as the organization expands. All future events, regardless of what they may be, will always hold the same fundamental goals: to promote understanding, foster a safe environment for discourse, and find common ground while not negating the importance of varying views.   \n\nPublic Forums planned by the Common Ground Collective will always be open to all UCLA students and faculty.",

    "description": "In response to the discomfort and health concerns associated with traditional undergarments, consumers have increasingly sought alternatives that provide both comfort and functionality. While nipple covers have emerged as a viable solution, the current market offerings often lack diversity and fail to address individual needs effectively.  Recognizing this gap, Brallium is committed to advance our current prototype of sustainable nipple covers and manufacture on a larger scale for UCLA students and beyond.\n\n1. Diverse and Inclusive Design: Brallium understands that individuals come in all shapes, sizes, and skin tones. Our nipple covers are meticulously crafted to cater to this diversity, seamlessly adapting to any skin tone and being gender-neutral. This inclusivity ensures that all individuals, regardless of their unique characteristics, can find comfort and confidence in the new nipple covers.\n2. Superior Protection for Breast and Skin Health: Unlike conventional nipple covers that may cause irritation or discomfort, Brallium's nipple cover prioritizes the health and well-being of our users. Our innovative design provides superior protection for breast and skin health, with an adhesive formula that is free from harmful chemicals. This ensures compatibility with sensitive skin, reducing the risk of rashes or acne, and promoting overall skin health.\n3. Environmental Sustainability: With the widespread use of silicone in nipple covers and its extended disposal time, users are increasingly seeking eco-friendly alternatives that reduce landfill space and mitigate potential risks to the ecosystem. At Brallium, nipple covers rely entirely on biomaterials, making them 100% biodegradable in water. By opting for our sustainable product, users can align their values with their purchasing decisions, actively contributing to a healthier planet for future generations.\n\nIn a nutshell, by prioritizing inclusivity, sustainability, and well-being, Brallium aims to meet the needs for inclusive sizes, shapes, and genders, minimize skin and breast health issues, and redefine sustainability in the undergarment experience.",

Central to its mission is the enhancement of patient awareness concerning the critical need for transparency with physicians about hormonal supplements. To fulfill this objective, THYRAISE has a strategic plan consisting of several key actions: First, the organization intends to collaborate with endocrinologists throughout the LA area to initiate clinical studies and surveys aimed at assessing patients' trust in their doctors, particularly regarding discussions about hormonal supplements. This initiative is designed to identify gaps in communication and foster a culture of openness and informed consent in patient care. Secondly, THYRAISE is set to develop a range of educational materials, including brochures, intended for distribution within endocrinology offices across Los Angeles. These materials are intended to educate patients on thyroid conditions, treatments, and risks of Over-The-Counter (OTC) thyroid supplements, providing them with the knowledge to engage in meaningful dialogues with their healthcare providers about the use of hormonal supplements. Lastly, THYRAISE plans to engage with policymakers and California state representatives, advocating for the enactment of legislation or directives that would enforce stricter regulations on the approval and accessibility of Over-The-Counter (OTC) thyroid supplements. Club members will also be active in the thyroidology community, attending events such as the USC Thyroid Day. Through these concerted efforts, THYRAISE aims to make a significant impact in the realm of thyroid health, focused on the causes of transparency, patient empowerment, and regulatory reform.",

The club members meet weekly during the school year to prepare lessons and practice lab demonstrations. The lessons on different STEM subjects are taught by the club members at local schools, catering to the interests of students of all age ranges. The emphasis is on teaching students in K-5 branches of physics such as electricity, magnetism, waves, and optics; however, we often branch out to other fields in STEM. Each lesson is accompanied by several spectacular demonstrations using the real laboratory equipment provided by the Department’s demo lab as well as presentations and additional demos designed and built by the club members.\n \nThe club members strongly believe that in order to get children interested in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects, science education should start at a very early age and each lesson should become a memorable experience for the kids. Club members have given presentations at the following schools: Norra Sterry Elementary School, Citizens of the World Mar Vista Charter School, Emerson Middle School, Palms Middle School, Fairburn Elementary School, Brentwood Science Magnet Elementary, and others.\n \nUndergraduate club member Nick Vincent has expressed his own enthusiasm for the program. \"The Science Teaching Club at UCLA gave me a great way to become involved in the community,\" said Nick. \"It encouraged me to use my passion for science to benefit local elementary schools. I think that my work with the Science Teaching Club has greatly augmented my education. The community service aspect has enriched my overall academic experience, the social aspect has allowed me to meet other physics students, and the cerebral challenge of designing quantum mechanics demonstrations for elementary school students truly engaged my mind.\"",

    "description": "Bridge at UCLA is a workshop and mentorship based program that aims to bridge educational gaps for underprivileged high school students. Through our research on current educational support efforts, we discovered a generational gap between established programs and the high school students they serve. Although these efforts are still impactful, the support is not as relevant to the current day academic and career atmosphere, and the connection between mentors and mentees is less meaningful. This inspired us to create a university based program that runs off current students that have relevant experience in these areas. \n\nBridge at UCLA aims to increase graduation rates through a mentorship program between collegiate students (at UCLA) and low-income students between the 10-12 grade range in local public schools. Our intent strays from increasing application turnout; instead, focusing on building strong professional skills to demonstrate career paths stemming from a high school diploma. As undergraduates with firsthand experience within higher education and the job market, our initiative is unique and relevant to high schools. On campus, we will recruit students through club fairs and departmental advertisements. We will search for students who are motivated to help youth, and train them to lead workshops and become one-on-one mentors. The workshops will be focused on a 5 stage curriculum of skill building, as outlined in the presented Journey Map, including:  resumes, interviewing, college advising, scholarship opportunities, and academic tutoring. However, a major aspect of this program will be its emphasis on existing opportunities that are available to students looking to join the workforce, utilizing skillful development from our program. The mentorship program fosters meaningful connections between volunteers and students to provide personalized support for creating a future pathway, with emphasis on empowerment and student-led connection during the program. Thus, rather than serving several students at once per mentor, we will cater the experience to be more individualized and direct. We will approach this initiative by partnering with schools in LAUSD, specifically those in low-income regions. This will personalize our approach to the schools because we will better understand what the students need, learning from both staff and students.",

The Fulbright Network at UCLA strives to be a community that offers friendship, support, and positive experiences for individuals far from their home countries. We welcome any individual on campus--whether you are far from home, or whether you seek to mingle with people with backgrounds different than your own--to join our communal activities and share your intellectual and cultural journey with us. \n\nFirst and foremost, we recognize the importance of human connections in academic success. The Fulbright Network therefore seeks to create opportunities where long-lasting friendships can blossom. We hope it will be a site for intellectual exchange, where individuals can get a deeper appreciation of diverse perspectives. \n\nWe also strive to support Fulbrighters with the often overwhelming logistics involved with moving to a new country. As a community, we can navigate the bumpy yet transformative journey we embarked on together. \n\nThe Fulbright Network hopes to be a resource and make a positive impact on Fulbrighters’ new and exciting chapter in the United States.",

With nine types of MD, all characterized by eventual loss of strength and mobility, individuals affected by these conditions face increasing disability and potential deformities. Although there is no cure, ongoing research and treatments provide hope for managing symptoms and improving quality of life.\nThe aim is to empower students to go beyond the classroom and engage in political advocacy and leadership. In partnership with the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA), we focus not only on muscular dystrophies but also on a wide range of neuromuscular disorders. By working together, we aim to shape healthcare policy and advocate for better patient care and research funding for these rare and often underrepresented diseases.\nOur mission centers on raising awareness of neuromuscular disorders within the medical and broader communities, while providing students with hands-on opportunities to explore careers in medicine. Through collaboration with national medical organizations and attendance at conferences, students can build professional networks and participate in meaningful discussions around the future of healthcare. These experiences will equip future healthcare leaders with the skills necessary to drive change in both patient care and medical research.\nWorking closely with the MDA to engage in political advocacy at the local, state, and national levels. We advocate for policies that promote funding for neuromuscular disease research, support patient access to cutting-edge treatments, and raise the profile of these rare diseases within the healthcare system. By involving medical students in these efforts, we aim to foster a new generation of physicians who are not only skilled clinicians but also leaders in healthcare policy and patient advocacy.\nIn addition to advocacy, our organization supports opportunities to learn more about MDS and other neuromuscular issues from talented faculty at UCLA involved in research. By partnering with UCLA Health physicians students will gain valuable insights into the challenges and advancements in the treatment of neuromuscular diseases. These efforts will allow students to see firsthand the importance of research in shaping the future of healthcare and improving patient outcomes.\nBy creating a network of student advocates for neuromuscular health, we hope to build a movement dedicated to improving the lives of individuals with neuromuscular diseases. Through leadership, advocacy, and education, the Muscular Dystrophy Society and Neuromuscular Illness Club will work to make a lasting impact on the future of medicine.",

It is an extension of a local non-profit, TechUp Los Angeles. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been forced to shift to remote working and video meetings that require some tech literacy skills. Yet, people experiencing homelessness may not have access to the technology needed to grow these skills. Given the existing hardships and disadvantages in the job market, learning tech literacy skills would help increase the amount and types of jobs this population can apply for. This can also be applied to other populations that struggle with tech literacy skills such as people from low income areas, elderly adults, and those who are returning from incarceration. While growing in tech literacy cannot knock down every barrier, having basic tech literacy skills brings us one step closer to an inclusive job market. Today, TechUp LA has partnered with seven local organizations throughout LA County where we provide monthly workshops to individuals on the basics of smartphones and computers. Thus, TechUp at UCLA hopes to amplify TechUp LA’s mission at UCLA and offer volunteer opportunities to current students to knock down technology barriers for underserved communities together.",

Collectively, members aim to support the local community in promoting medical communication to help reduce clinical anxiety in children. Our various stations run as 'hospitals' for children's teddy bears and are designed as a hands-on experience that allows children to better understand healthcare, reduce medical associated fears, and inspire them to pursue higher education. \n\nOur organization offers allied-health students opportunities to practice working with children and experience teaching health care. Students learn important pediatric communication skills, such as building rapport and using child-friendly language. Volunteers diffuse complex medical information and explain important health questions to participating children. \n\nVision\n\nIn our Teddy Bear Hospital mock hospital sessions, children will bring a beloved teddy (or are loaned one) and treat their teddy bears with empathy, learn about patient care, and discover careers in medicine.

Our activities promote healthy habits and instill confidence, paving the way for lifelong positive attitudes toward healthcare.\n\n\nUnique Value Proposition \n\nTeddy Bear Hospital DGSOM is unique in that it utilizes a play based approach to encourage children to be involved in their healthcare. We hope to use this approach to foster interest in health and higher education specifically in low SES areas in LA county. We also want to use this to teach medical students how to interact with pediatric patients.\n\n\nStructure \nEach of the following positions are eligible for self-nomination. Leadership will be passed down year-to-year by application, interview, and leadership vote.

Then, the organization expanded to include beginner/intermediate training teams, allowing anyone interested in dance to grow, train, and challenge themselves in a safe space. This soon led to the introduction of Wintensive, an annual event where professional choreographers come to teach the UCLA community for free, fostering greater cultural and dance awareness. Now, the organization has quarterly training teams and celebrates their achievements during our quarterly showcases. We also host workshops every quarter to continue to inspire and educate more dancers with various cultural dances and techniques.",

We celebrate cultural diversity, showcasing the rich traditions, dialects, and arts of the Arab world. Through creative expression, we host poetry readings, storytelling, and calligraphy workshops, encouraging members to connect with Arabic’s artistic heritage. We also delve into historical roots, exploring how periods like the pre-Islam, Umayyad, and Abbasid era shaped the language and its literature.\n\nActivities include cultural events, literary evenings, interactive workshops, and guest lectures by scholars and artists. Together, we create a supportive community where the Arabic language and its cultural legacy can thrive.\nal-Arabiyya is simply a space where the Arabic language and culture bloom together.",

    "description": "Classroom Care is a non-profit organization and current club at Chatsworth Charter High School (CCHS) that utilizes communities of motivated students to work together in order to create seasonal gift bags for children at schools in low-income communities while making fun, kid-friendly Youtube videos that include craft tutorials, book readings, and entertaining games for the children to watch in class.\n\nI started Classroom Care during the summer of 2022 in order to spread joy to children in low-income communities. After completing my sophomore year of high school, I reflected on my past and remembered the many fond memories of my childhood that I currently hold onto. Because these memories have comforted me on my path towards adulthood, I believe that all children are deserving of creating special memories they can carry with them as they grow older, regardless of their family’s financial position.\n\nI reached out to my fellow students at CCHS to form a student-led board to help me run the Classroom Care club and by using Classroom Care’s Instagram account, I was able to generate interest in the club and find members who shared a common interest in helping younger generations. As Classroom Care grew, I raised funds from friends and family through Snap Raise and held fundraisers at local restaurants who gave the organization a percentage of the profits. I also created classroomcare.org, which allows more people to donate to the organization online. Due to the additional funding of over $4,000 raised, Classroom Care was able to expand its services into more classrooms, allowing more students to be included. Club members would also visit the students in person, first thing in the morning, before our high school opened at 10:00 am on Tuesdays. We would read books to the kids and bring craft projects to do with them.\n\nAfter Classroom Care’s first year, the club board decided to create a Youtube Channel in order to reach students that we were unable to visit in person, specifically because CCHS eliminated late-start Tuesdays which made it more difficult to do personal class visits. Each monthly video is dedicated to a holiday or season. Members in the videos are dressed according to that month’s theme, and they are filmed packing the students’ gifts, reading children’s books, making a no-bake treat, partaking in challenges, and walking the kids through a craft tutorial for a craft that each student receives beforehand in their gift package. The videos are designed to be played by the students’ teacher, who distributes our gift packages to them.\n\nTo further expand Classroom Care, I wrote a children’s book, Peach Pit,  that was inspired by the students I have met while visiting their classrooms. The kids get very excited when I read them stories, so I decided to write a book that they could enjoy and learn from. The book was released on Amazon in December of 2023 and 100% of the profits go towards Classroom Care.\n\nAt UCLA, I would like to continue my passion for volunteer work for children and expand the organization's reach by generating a larger volume of club members who are also dedicated to making an impact in the lives of so many young students. I want to continue utilizing my creativity by filming and editing Youtube videos, creating media, and planning club events while also regularly visiting classrooms in person. With the combined efforts of UCLA students, Classroom Care can increase its influence and make use of the ideas of students from all different backgrounds.",
